# **App Name**: AICooperative

## Core Features:

- AI Chat Selection: Allow the user to choose between multiple pre-configured AI "personalities" for each chat. The selected AI will affect the responses that the user receives.
- Chat Interface: Provide a chat interface for interacting with the AI.  The interface will use a familiar design using message bubbles, similar to other chat applications.
- Multiple Independent Chats: Enable users to manage and maintain multiple independent chat sessions, each isolated from the others and available to rename, archive, or delete.
- Chat history and context: Every chat should keep track of what was said, so the AI knows the conversation history.
- AI Personality Tool: The LLM tool will consider what personality has been assigned to the chat by the user and alter its reponses to match that profile, taking the assigned role and designated goals of the user profile into account.
- Save and Export Conversations: Offer functionality to save and export the chat history for later review or sharing.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4), evoking trust, intelligence, and clarity, referencing the 'intelligence' aspect.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), provides a calm and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Purple (#9C27B0), a creative spark that helps to highlight calls to action.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Employ a responsive, grid-based layout reminiscent of tools like ChatGPT or Notion. The primary dashboard displays chats in an organized list. Use collapsible sections and tabs for secondary navigation.
- Use minimalist, clear icons for actions (rename, archive, delete) and categories.
- Employ subtle transitions and animations for loading states and interactions to provide feedback and enhance usability without distracting from the core functionality.
